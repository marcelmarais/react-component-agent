I would like you to help me create a design system using Tailwind CSS classes. This design system will be used throughout my React App components. The deliverable should be a text file containing all the relevant classes, organized per component. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

Input Parameters:

Deliverables:
Please output a text file with the following sections:

Typography: List Tailwind CSS classes for headings (H1, H2, H3), paragraphs, and links.

Color Scheme: Based on the accent color ({accent_colour}), list Tailwind CSS classes for background, text, and border colors.

Buttons: List Tailwind CSS classes for primary and secondary buttons.

Forms: List Tailwind CSS classes for form elements like input fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

Spacing and Layout: List classes for padding, margin, and layout components like flexbox or grid.

Additional Components: List any other Tailwind CSS classes for components you think would fit well with the aesthetic: {aesthetic}.

Constraints:
Please only use Tailwind CSS classes available in the latest version.
Ensure the classes are compatible with React.
Compile all of this into a text file for easy reference and make sure to separate each section with appropriate headers.
